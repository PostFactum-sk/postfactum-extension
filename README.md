## PostFactum.sk Chrome Extension

PostFactum.sk is a framework for classifying trust for online sources

The postfactum.sk API server is still under development.  
Therefore, during the development of this extension, please use a staging server.  
The URL to the admin interface is: [https://stg.postfactum.sk/admin/](https://stg.postfactum.sk/admin/)  
Username and password can be obtained from the project admin.  

This extension is inspired by [bullshit-detector](https://github.com/websupport-sk/https://github.com/websupport-sk/bullshit-detector)  
Any help in developing the extension is welcome :)
